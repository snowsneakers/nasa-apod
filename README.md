# NASA APOD
Using the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API, <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">link here</a>, this site provides a new picture and description everyday. Using the input, the user can search for any day in the past. Enjoy all of the informative descriptions, beautiful images, and awesome videos.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The Pictures and description are pulled from the NASA APOD API. Image is blended by using radial and linear gradients depending on screen size. I tried to make the desktop image look like the user was looking through a telescope.

## Lessons Learned:

I wanted to work with gradients to improve the look of the site and also improve my css skills. I also refined my API knowledge by fetching data and appending it to the dom.
